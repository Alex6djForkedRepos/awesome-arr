# Contribution Guidelines

Please note that this project is released with a
[Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this
project you agree to abide by its terms.

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Follow the format `- [Name](link) - A small description.`
- Maintain alphabetical order in each category.
- Submitted projects must meet a popularity threshold:
    - **GitHub:** Minimum 50 stars.
    - **Other Platforms:** Comparable community interest.

I apologize if this feels like an arbitrary hurdle. Unfortunately, to keep this list focused and manageable, 
and to ensure it highlights projects that have demonstrated some level of community validation, 
I need a way to fairly filter submissions. I simply cannot include every project, and without some kind of metric, 
reviewing and rejecting projects becomes very subjective and unsustainable.

This check is an attempt to introduce a degree of fairness and objectivity to the process. Thank you for your understanding.

## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
