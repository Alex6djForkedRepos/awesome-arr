# Contribution Guidelines

Please note that this project is released with a

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Follow the format `- [Name](link) - A small description.`
- Maintain alphabetical order in each category.
- Submitted projects must meet a popularity threshold:
    - **GitHub:** Minimum 50 stars.
    - **Other Platforms:** Comparable community interest.

I apologize if this feels like an arbitrary hurdle. Unfortunately, to keep this list focused and manageable, 
and to ensure it highlights projects that have demonstrated some level of community validation, 
I need a way to fairly filter submissions. I simply cannot include every project, and without some kind of metric, 
reviewing and rejecting projects becomes very subjective and unsustainable.

This check is an attempt to introduce a degree of fairness and objectivity to the process. Thank you for your understanding.
